# Fuzzy Logic of Quantum Braitenberg Vehicles
This repository builds a computer simulation to observe the fuzzy logic behavior of quantum controlled Braitenberg vehicles. Braitenberg vehicles were an early thought experiment in cybernetics conceived by Valentino Braitenberg, and a brief introduction to them can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle). The observations from the above simulation were accepted in the 11th International Conference on Quantum Interaction (QI2018), a copy of which can be found [here](https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01839282/file/QI_2018_QBV-fuzzy-robot-paper_HAL.pdf). Kindly cite the source if you use the code as follows:

## Running the Code
There is a pre-compiled `Quantum_BV.jar` file availalbe to run the simulation without needing the JDK. To run the simulation, simply execute the following command:

`java -jar Quantum_BV.jar`

Some instructions for running the simulation:
 - Right click adds a new vehicle with a random angle of initial movement.
 - Left click adds a "light" source.
 - Any new car added has the quantum gates currently selected from the drop down menus. Any changes made in the selection only affect the future vehicles added to the screen.
 - The window includes a CLEAR button to clear the screen and begin again.
 - The screen is thought of as a continous canvas, and a vehicle dissapearing on the right side returns from the left. Another option is to have a "bounce wall" where if a car hits the boundary it is reflected back. This option is currently commented out in the function `changePosition()` of `Vehicle.java`.

If required, any changes made to the code can be recomplied into a `.jar` file by executing:

`jar cfmv Quantum_BV.jar bin/manifest.txt bin/*.class`

## Some Results
The figure below shows some results that we were able to achieve using the simulation.
